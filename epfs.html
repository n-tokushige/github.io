<b>Errata</b>

<ol>
<li> page 206, line 5, in the RHS of the polynomial \( f_y \) the second
sum should be taken over \( I, K \) instead of \( J, K \).
On the same page there are some \( x, y, z\) which should be 
written in the math bold face. 

<li> page 7, line 13, "\( S_x (S_y (\mathcal F)) = S_y (S_x (\mathcal F)) \)"
is wrong. In fact, if \( \mathcal F = \{ \{x,y,z\}, \{z\} \} \) then
\( S_x (S_y (\mathcal F)) = \{ \{x,z\}, \{z\} \} \) while
\( S_y (S_x (\mathcal F)) = \{ \{y,z\}, \{z\} \} \).
The point here is that 
if \( x \in F \in S_x(\mathcal F) \) then 
\( F \setminus \{x\} \in S_x(\mathcal F) \), and moreover this property
is unchanged even if we replace \( S_x(\mathcal F) \) with
\( S_y(S_x(\mathcal F)) \). Noted by Bjarne Schülke, 2019.07.26.

<li> page 8, proof of Proposition 2.6, replace \( \mathcal F \)
and \( S_x(\mathcal F) \) with \( \mathcal F|_T \) and
\( S_x(\mathcal F)|_T \), respectively. Noted by Bjarne Schülke, 2019.07.29.

<li> page 8, line -2, delete "\( \in \)"

<li> page 13, in the proof of Theorem 3.1, "\( X \)" should be "\( [n] \)"
(two places).

<li> page 15, line 3--5, "For any \(\mathcal F\subset 2^X\) ... is not true"
should be "If \(\mathcal F\subset 2^X \) satisfies that \( |\mathcal F|_Y|=t \)
for all \( Y \in \binom Xy \), then \( (|X|,|\mathcal F|) \rightarrow (y,t+1) \)
is not true." Noted by Bjarne Schülke, 2019.07.29.

<li> page 21, line 9, at the end of the sentence, $\mathcal G(n)$ should be 
$\mathcal G(\bar n)$.

<li> page 21, proof of Theorem 4.5: The induction is written in a
confusing way. The actual scheme should be as follows.
Let $S(n,s)$ be the statement that "if $|G\cup G'|\leq n-s$ holds for all
$G,G'\in\mathcal G$ then (i) or (ii) holds." We will show $S(n,s)$ for 
$\{(n,s): n\geq 1,\, n\geq s\geq 1\}$.
Note that for all $n\geq 1$ we have $S(n,n)$ and $S(n,1)$. In fact the latter is
equivalent to Theorem 1.3 (i).
Also $S(n,n-1)$ is true for all $n\geq 2$ (this is the $n=s+1$ case).
Thus $S(3,s)$ is true for $1\leq s\leq 3$ at this point.
Now choose $n\geq 4$ and then $1\leq s\leq n-1$ arbitrarily, and we show
$S(n,s)$ by induction on $n$. Our assumption is that $S(n',s')$ is true
for all $1\leq n'< n$ and $n' \geq s'\geq 1$. So we can apply $S(n-1,s-1)$ to
$\mathcal G(\bar n)$ and $S(n-1,s+1)$ to $\mathcal G(n)$.

<li> page 10, the proof of Theorem 2.14: 
The first two lines of the proof should be replaced with the following.
"We prove the statement by induction on $k$ and $x$. 
One can verify the statement for the case $k=1$ (and 
$x\geq k$). Let $k\geq 2$, and assume that the statement holds for all
$(k',x')$ with $k'\leq x'$ and $k' < k$. We show the statement for $(k,x)$
with $x\geq k$. The case $x=k$ is trivial, so we suppose $x\geq k+1$, that is,"

<li> page 24, line -5: $\mathcal F=1,2,1,3,2,3$ should be
$\mathcal F=\{\{1,2\},\{1,3\},\{2,3\}\}$.

<li> page 26, line -5: at the end of the displayed equation
should be 
"$\ldots\leq \displaystyle \sum_{S\in\mathcal S}\frac 1 {\binom n{|S|}}\leq 1$"
instead of 
"$\ldots\leq\displaystyle\sum_{S\in\mathcal S} \frac 1 {\binom n{\lfloor\frac n{|S|}\rfloor}}\leq 1$."

<li> page 28, line -13: "Let $t\geq 2$" should be "Let $r\geq 2$."

<li> page 28, line -3: "arcs $F_1^{(j)},\ldots,F_r^{(j)},$ where ..." 
should be
"arcs $F_1^{(j)},\ldots,F_r^{(j)}$ of size $k_1,\ldots,k_r$, respectively, where ..."

<li> page 29, between line 13 and 14: add "If $r=2$ then we may assume that
$k_1=1, k_2=n$, but in this case $\mathcal F_1$ and $\mathcal F_2$ cannot be 
2-cross union. So we may assume that $r\geq 3$." 
Noted by Bjarne Schülke, 2019.08.04.

<li> page 29, line 14: "assume that $|F_s| < n$" should be "assume that 
$|\mathcal F_s| < n$."

<li> page 31, line -3: "$A=\{2,7.10\}$" should be "$A=\{2,7,10\}$."

<li> page 32, line -2: "$\binom{[n]}k$" should be "$\binom{[a_k]}k$."

<li> page 33, line -8: the first term in the RHS of the displayed equation
should be "$\binom{a_{k-1}}{k-2}$" instead of "$\binom{a_{k-1}}{k-1}$." 

<li> page 35, line 6: "$|\mathcal F(1)| \leq \ldots$"
should be "$|\mathcal F(1)| \geq \ldots$"

<li> page 35, line 12: "then (b) and the induction hypothesis ..." should be
"then the induction hypothesis and (a) ..." 

<li> page 41, line 5: "Let $l,s,m$, ... integers." should be
"Let $l,s,m$, ... integers with $n=ms$."

<li> page 41, at the end of the last sentence: "$1\leq i\leq 2(m-l)+1$" 
should be "$1\leq i\leq 2(m-l)-1$."

<li> page 125, line 10: the last term is $(N-v+1)$ instead of $(N-v-1)$.
(2021.02.22)

<li> page 55, (10.2): 
the RHS is $(k-t+1)(2+\frac{t-1}{r})$
instead of $(k-t+1)(2+\frac{r-1}r)$.

<li> page 57, in the middle, displayed inequlaity:
the RHS is $(k'-t'+1)(2+\frac{t'-1}{r'})$
instead of $(k'-t'+1)(2+\frac{r-1}r')$.
(2022.09.28)

<li> page 198, line $-9$:
"with new $n\times n$ matrices" should be "with new $2^n\times 2^n$ matrices."
